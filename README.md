#  Shopper Behavior and Revenue Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing online shopper behavior and predicting the likelihood of purchase (Revenue) using various machine learning and deep learning techniques.

##  Project Objectives
- Understand shopper browsing behavior through EDA
- Preprocess the data and handle class imbalance with SMOTE
- Evaluate and compare ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest)
- Develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras
- Deploy an interactive Streamlit dashboard

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

##  Results
| Model                  | Accuracy |
| Logistic Regression    | 87%      |
| SVM                    | 82%      |
| KNN                    | 86%      |
| Random Forest          | *94%*    |
| ANN (Deep Learning)    | 91%      |
